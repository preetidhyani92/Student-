# DESCRIPTION

🎓 Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

This beginner-friendly project predicts whether a student will Pass or Fail based on their Study Hours, Attendance, and Test Scores using Logistic Regression.

It demonstrates how simple machine learning models can help in academic performance analysis and decision-making.

🎯 Project Objective

To build a predictive model that estimates a student’s success probability based on key academic factors.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

scikit-learn

Algorithm: Logistic Regression

📊 Key Steps

Create a sample dataset for students

Preprocess and split data into training and testing sets

Train a Logistic Regression model

Evaluate using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Visualize relationship between study hours and test scores

Predict results for new students

📈 Insights

Increased study hours and attendance improve test performance

Logistic Regression effectively classifies Pass/Fail results

Demonstrates model evaluation and visualization in an easy, practical way

🧠 Future Scope

Use real-world datasets (e.g., student exams, Kaggle data)

Apply advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)

Build an interactive dashboard (e.g., Streamlit or Power BI)
